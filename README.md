# Flight Graph Visualizer
This application runs in a console and displays one of three chosen graphs in a separate window based on flight data. The three options are: "Altitude vs Horizontal Distance", "Altitude vs Time", and "Flight Speed vs Time". After the graph is printed, the data from the graph is output to a text file named "output.txt".  
  
The program was created in C++ utilizing Visual Studio.
